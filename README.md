# SauerSauce
A place to learn and share Sauerbraten

<strong>Informations</strong>
<br>
SauerSauce is basically a repository in github with an appearance of site/blog.
<br>
I decided to adopt this Wiki style because I think it fits better with the platform I'm using (Github Pages).
<br>
Well, like in a classic wiki, you can change/add pages and then post them after other people verify your modifications.
<br>
You do not need to follow the same rules of a "real" wiki (like keeping the text formal or neutral).
<br>
Do not forget to cite the sources.
<br>
<br>
There is no embedded html editor, this means you must format the page manually (or use an external online editor).
<br>
<br>
We use Jekyll to take care of the organization of the posts, pages, descriptions and everything that is impossible to update manually.
<br>
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software)">Jekyll</a> is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites.)
<br>
<br>
The site was completely made from scratch by me, my skills are not many, so feel free to improve or fix something that is out of place.
<br>
As you may have noticed, this simple theme with strange colors is based on the sauerbraten.org color palette.

<br>
<br>
Step 1:
<br>
Fork the repository (you only need to do this once) <br>
By forking the repository, it will be added to your account, and any modifications you make will be sent to it.
<br>
Go to your forked repository: https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/sauer-sauce.github.io
<br>
<br>
Step 2:
<br>
Create or send files (you need to select the folder first)
<br>
For example if you want to create a new post, go to the _posts folder and create a new file:
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gEuCd7J.png"/>
<br>
Do not forget to put the date in the title, otherwise your pull request can be denied.
<br>
<br>
Step 3:
<br>
Sending a Pull request
<br>
After adding your modifications, it's time to send them to the original repository
<br>
This part is very intuitive, you will see all the files you have modified, add a title and description so your Pull Request can be recognized...
<br>
<br>
If you followed all the steps, I should receive your Pull request and accept it as soon as I check your modifications
<br>
<br>
Do not forget to update your repository always before sending/creating a file!
